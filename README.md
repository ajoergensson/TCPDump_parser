# TCPdump_parser
TCPDump Parser to analyse traffic

# Use the app in the following way:
## sudo tcpdump -nli ens33 | python tcpdump.py

#Issues
## Having issues to use local variables with the threads
## Implement further functions as summarising used protocols
## DNS Uses often 3 IPs (part of A record resolution)
## - (Iterate on line to calculate more than 2 IPs)
